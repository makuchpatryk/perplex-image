## ✅ Installation Complete

Playwright E2E tests have been successfully added to the PerplexImage project!

## 📦 What Was Added

### Files Created:

1. **playwright.config.ts** - Playwright configuration
2. **tests/e2e/main.spec.ts** - Core functionality tests (31+ tests)
3. **tests/e2e/advanced.spec.ts** - Advanced tests with fixtures (14 test groups)
4. **tests/e2e/fixtures.ts** - Reusable test fixtures
5. **tests/e2e/README.md** - Detailed test documentation

### Package Updated:

- **@playwright/test** v1.58.2 added to devDependencies

### Scripts Added to package.json:

- `pnpm test:e2e` - Run all tests
- `pnpm test:e2e:ui` - Run tests with interactive UI
- `pnpm test:e2e:debug` - Run tests in debug mode

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Run All Tests

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

This will:

- Start the dev server automatically
- Run tests on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers
- Generate an HTML report

### 2. Run Tests in UI Mode (Recommended for First Time)

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:ui
```

This opens an interactive test runner where you can:

- See tests executing in real-time
- Inspect elements on the page
- Debug individual tests
- Step through test execution

### 3. View Test Report

After running tests:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

Opens an HTML report with:

- Test results and timing
- Screenshots of failures
- Network traces
- Video recordings

### 4. Run Specific Test

```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/main.spec.ts
```

### 5. Run Tests in Debug Mode

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:debug
```

Opens Playwright Inspector for stepping through tests.

### 6. Run Tests with Browser Visible

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

## 📚 Test Structure Example

```typescript
test("should start game with selected image and difficulty", async ({
  page,
}) => {
  await page.goto("/");
  await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle");

  // Select difficulty level
  const option15x23 = page.locator('input[value="15x23"]');
  await option15x23.click();

  // Start game
  const startBtn = page
    .locator("button")
    .filter({ hasText: /Start|Play|Begin/i });
  if (await startBtn.isVisible()) {
    await startBtn.click();
    await page.waitForURL(/\/game\//);

    // Verify game started
    expect(page.url()).toContain("/game/");
  }
});
```

## 🔍 Advanced Features

### Using Custom Fixtures

```typescript
test("complete game flow", async ({
  page,
  navigateToHome,
  selectDifficulty9x13,
  startGame,
}) => {
  await navigateToHome();
  await selectDifficulty9x13();
  await startGame();

  expect(page.url()).toContain("/game/");
});
```

### Taking Screenshots

```typescript
await page.screenshot({ path: "screenshot.png" });
```

### Generating Locators

```bash
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:3000
```

This opens a tool to interactively generate test code.

## 📝 Configuration Details

- **Base URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Test Timeout**: 30 seconds per test
- **Navigation Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Retries**: 0 in local mode, 2 in CI
- **Workers**: All available (local), 1 (CI)
- **Screenshots**: On failure only
- **Traces**: On first retry

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Tests timeout

```bash
# Increase timeout
npx playwright test --timeout=60000
```

### Browser not starting

```bash
# Install browsers
npx playwright install
```

### API fails

Check that:

- Dev server is running on http://localhost:3000
- Pexels API key is valid
- Internet connection is active

### Tests are too slow

```bash
# Run on specific browser only
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

## 🎓 Next Steps

1. **Run tests**: `pnpm test:e2e:ui`
2. **Explore**: Open interactive test runner
3. **Review report**: `npx playwright show-report`
4. **Add more tests**: Create new .spec.ts files in tests/e2e/
5. **Integrate CI/CD**: Add tests to GitHub Actions or other CI

## 📝 Notes

- Dev server starts automatically during tests
- Tests use real Pexels API (ensure API key is valid)
- Tests are idempotent and can run multiple times
- All test results saved in `playwright-report/` directory
